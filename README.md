An Intelligent Traffic Control System Incorporating Deep Learning and Computer Vision with Prioritized and Dynamic Timing:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traffic congestion has emerged as a pervasive challenge across global urban landscapes, inducing delays, productivity losses, and heightened air pollu-tion. Conventional traffic signal systems often falter in adapting to evolving traffic dynamics, compromising road network efficiency. To address this a novel paradigm-a smart traffic control system leveraging advanced computer technology is proposed. This system employs real-time monitoring and anal-ysis to dynamically adjust traffic signals, optimizing traffic flow and mitigat-ing congestion-related adversities. The integration of deep learning and com-puter vision technologies is used to enable a nuanced understanding of visual data and patterns. Remarkably, the YOLO tool is utilized to enhance the sys-tem's capacity to swiftly identify emergency vehicles and give them priority. The proposed system is designed to efficiently handle traffic density and in-cludes features for prioritizing emergency vehicles. Furthermore, it employs a non-uniform allocation of waiting times to lanes, which is contingent upon real-time traffic density and patterns. A working model demo was designed and it was found effective in making intelligent decisions.

**Role of Deep Learning and Computer Vision :**
The work relies on the integration of deep learning and computer vision. Deep learning, exemplified by the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, is the cornerstone of the vehicle detection mechanism. YOLO's speed and accuracy in simultaneously identifying and classifying objects are crucial for real-time vehi-cle recognition.

Computer vision, working in tandem with deep learning, helps to extract contex-tually relevant information from video frames, forming the basis for traffic anal-ysis. By applying computer vision techniques, visual data is converted into valu-able insights, so that the traffic patterns, vehicle behavior, and presence of emer-gency vehicles may be analysed. The synergy between deep learning and com-puter vision enables the system to intelligently and adaptively respond to changing traffic dynamics, facilitating efficient vehicle detection and dynamic traffic flow optimization through real-time traffic signal adjustments informed by computer vision insights.
